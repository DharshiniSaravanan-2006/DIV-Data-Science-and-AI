# ðŸš€ DIV - Data Anlytics and AI
Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

# ðŸŽ‰ Exciting News!

 Our college has launched a Department Industrial Vertical (DIV) initiative â€” a program designed to help us strengthen domain-specific skills and bridge the gap between academic learning and industry requirements.

I have chosen the Data Analytics and AI vertical because of my deep interest in the field of Data Science.

During our DIV sessions, with the guidance of our mentor, we built a Data Pipeline that integrates various data sources and performs meaningful transformations.
